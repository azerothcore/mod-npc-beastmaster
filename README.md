- Latest build status with azerothcore: [![Build Status](https://github.com/azerothcore/mod-npc-beastmaster/workflows/core-build/badge.svg?branch=master&event=push)](https://github.com/azerothcore/mod-npc-beastmaster)

# AzerothCore - BeastMaster NPC

## Description

This module allows **all classes** (not just hunters) to adopt and use hunter pets by interacting with a special NPC. The NPC provides:
- Hunter skills (for non-hunters)
- Adoption of normal, rare, and exotic pets (all loaded from `beastmaster_tames` table)
- Pet food vendor
- Stables (for hunters)
- **Tracked pets system**: view, summon, rename, and delete your adopted pets

Players can also summon the Beastmaster NPC anywhere using chat commands.

## Important Notes

- You have to use at least AzerothCore commit [3f0739f](https://github.com/azerothcore/azerothcore-wotlk/commit/3f0739f1c9a5289444ff9d62834b7ceb38879ba9).
- The config file (`mod_npc_beastmaster.conf.dist`) controls rare and rare exotic pet highlighting by entry ID.
- Tracked pets are stored in the `beastmaster_tamed_pets` table in your characters database.
- Profanity filtering for pet names uses `conf/profanity.txt` (reloads automatically if changed).
- Tracked pets cache is session-based, thread-safe, and updates instantly after rename/delete.

## Tracked Pets Feature

- When you adopt a pet, it is automatically tracked and stored in the database.
- You can view your tracked pets from the BeastMaster NPC menu (all classes supported).
- For each tracked pet, you can:
  - **Summon**: Instantly summon the pet if you do not already have one out.
  - **Rename**: Select "Rename" and then type the new name in chat using the `.petname rename <name>` command. Type `.petname cancel` to abort.
  - **Delete**: Remove the pet from your tracked list (with confirmation).
- The tracked pets menu supports pagination if you have many pets.
- The menu displays each pet's name, date tamed, family, and rarity.
- Tracked pets update instantly after rename or delete.

## Pet Rename Commands

When you choose to rename a pet, you must use the following chat commands:
- `.petname rename <newname>` — Renames your selected pet to `<newname>`.
- `.petname cancel` — Cancels the renaming process.

If you type anything else, you will be reminded of these commands.

## How to use ingame

### Option 1: Chat Commands (Recommended)
Players can summon the Beastmaster anywhere using a chat command:
- `.beastmaster` — Summons the Beastmaster NPC at your location for 2 minutes

### Option 2: Spawn NPC Permanently
As GM:
- Add NPC permanently:
 ```
 .npc add 601026
 ```
- Add NPC temporarily:
 ```
 .npc add temp 601026
 ```

The NPC will appear as "White Fang" (entry: **601026**).

> **Note:**  
> The value `601026` is the default Beastmaster NPC entry used by this module.  
> If you wish to use a different NPC entry, update the `BeastMaster.NpcEntry` value in your `mod_npc_beastmaster.conf` file and adjust your database and configuration accordingly.

## Player Login Notice

When players log in, they will see a helpful message:
> **BeastMaster Commands Available!**  
> Type `.beastmaster` to summon the Beastmaster and adopt pets!

This notice can be disabled in the configuration file if desired.

## Notice:

Due to the uniqueness of the module you will get this message on the worldconsole, but nothing is broken.
It is due to the npc not exactly having a gossip menu in the database, the script handles the gossip menu.

To suppress this warning, add the following to your worldserver config:
```
#    Creatures.CustomIDs
#        Description: The list of custom creatures with gossip dialogues hardcoded in core,
#                     divided by "," without spaces.
#                     It is implied that you do not use for these NPC dialogs data from "gossip_menu" table.
#                     Server will skip these IDs during the definitions validation process.
#        Example:     Creatures.CustomIDs = "190010,55005,999991,25462,98888,601026" - Npcs for Transmog, Guild-zone, 1v1-arena modules
#                                                                               Skip Dk Module, Racial Trait Swap Modules
#        Default:     ""

Creatures.CustomIDs = "190010,55005,999991,25462,98888,601026"
```
