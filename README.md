### Description

WhiteFang is a Beastmaster NPC that howls! This NPC allows any player, or only Hunters, to adopt and use beasts.
He also teaches the player specific Hunter skills for use with their beasts. A player can adopt normal or exotic
beasts depending on how you've configured the NPC. For each type of beast I use a rare spawn model of a creature
of the same type, so they all look cool. He also sells a great selection of grub for every level of beast. Hunters
can access the stables as well. He can also attract the player using configurable emote options.
